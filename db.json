Allow to steam for about 30 seconds before pouring the scrambled egg mixture evenly over the meat and veggies. This is where the technique comes in. Avoid the temptation to stir. Simply allow the skillet to sit 2 to three minutes. Then, using a wooden spoon or spatula, begin flipping sections of egg and veggies (similar to how you would fold whipped egg whites into a cake batter, just gently fold the scramble onto itself). Once all sections have been flipped over, everything to sit and cook another 2 or 3 minutes. Repeat the flipping.  Continue doing this until the egg is no longer cooking to the skillet."

Make sure to drizzle oil on the baking sheet so it does not stick to the sheet when it begins to caramelize. If you do not have an oven you can choose to fry the plantain balls as well. I have not tried the frying method but make sure to dab off the excess oil from the plantain.In a separate pot, on very low heat, melt the butter and pour in the sugar, vanilla, milk and water and stir. Leave it on very low heat throughout. Stir once in a while and if you have a candy thermometer, it is ready at 240F. If you do not, the toffee base is ready when it turns light brown like a caramel colour.Dip the plantain balls and swirl and place on a plate to cool. While its still warm, sprinkle your toppings on it. In this case, my toppings were coconut flakes."
