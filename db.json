      "steps": "In a pan, saut garlic in olive oil until light brown.\nAdd onions. Saute until almost translucent.\nAdd the ground pork and sprinkle with  tsp salt and  tsp blackpepper. Stir-fry until no more pink color is showing.\nAdd carrots, oyster sauce and fish sauce.  Mix well.\nAdd shrimps and cook until pink then add egg. Mix well and remove from heat. Allow to completely cool down. Drain if necessary. Set aside the sauce.\nThe lumpia wrappers are very tightly packed, so be careful when pulling them apart.  Spoon 1 Tbsp mixture on the lower edge of the wrapper leaving 1 inch edge. Begin to fold egg roll like an envelope: first, fold over the lower 1 inch edge over the filing, then the left edge, then the right edge, then roll up to the top edge. To seal the wrapper just moisten the top edge with water. I used the sauce I got from draining the cooked mixture.\nHeat vegetable oil in a large, deep frying pan over medium high heat. Place egg roll one at a time into hot oil, with the seam down (this will keep it from unraveling) and then quickly turn the egg roll to ensure the skin crisp up and does not stick to other egg rolls in the pan. Adjust heat so that the oil is bubbling gently and not too vigorously around the egg rolls. Each egg roll will take about 5 minutes to cook. Shake the egg roll over the pan to help remove the excess oil. Place egg roll on layers of paper towels to drain.\nServe the lumpia or Filipino egg rolls with your favorite sweet and sour sauce or a spicy vinegar sauce.",

Set the bowl over the pot and whisk the lime mixture occasionally until it thickens, approximately 10 minutes. Then whisk in the butter, 1 piece at a time.

Slowly add the sugar, then the cream of tartar, continuing to whip until well incorporated. Increase the stand mixer to medium speed and whip until the whites are shiny and form a stiff peak.

Add your egg and mix well. Mix in baking powder, baking soda, Kool-Aid and cornstarch. Once its well mixed (the Kool-Aid will be mixed once it turns your dough pink), add a drop of pink food coloring, if more color is desired. Next, start adding your flour a half cup at a time until its all added.Roll the dough into walnut-sized balls and roll in the powder sugar, giving them a light coating. Place 2 apart on a room-temp baking sheet (let your sheet cool in between batches if you are reusing the same one).Bake in the oven 9-10 minutes, they wont brown too much, so watch them closely. Over-baking will make them hard and crunchy!I hope you enjoy these!

      "steps": "1.Heat the oven the to 400F. Place the plums on a rimmed cookie sheet (lined with parchment paper for easier cleanup) and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of the sugar. Roast until the plums are browning and tender but not falling apart, about 15 minutes.\n2.Bring about 2 inches of water to a bare simmer in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to maintain a bare simmer. Combine the egg yolks, the remaining 4 tablespoons sugar, the plum brandy mixture, and a pinch of salt in a round-bottomed metal mixing bowl; whisk thoroughly.\n3.Set the bowl over the simmering waterthe base of the bowl should not touch the waterand whisk continuously. The egg yolks will begin to froth, lighten, and grow greatly in volume. If you sense that the yolks are at risk of scrambling, quickly remove the bowl from the heat and whisk to cool slightly, then continue. When soft peaks form, after 5 to10 minutes, the zabaglione is done. Transfer to a clean bowl, cover, and refrigerate.\n4.To serve, place 6 plum halves in the bottom of each of 4 glasses. Give the zabaglione a quick whisk and spoon it on top of the plums. Serve immediately.",

It is important to get the oil nice and hot (not smoking, just before that point) your shrimp should sizzle when added to the pan. Check the back of the shrimp and when you see the colour change about half way up, turn them over. Do the same on the other side. This should only take a minute to two minutes maximum on both sides  otherwise you will get a rubbery result if you leave it too long. Squeeze over the lime juice  this too should bubble and reduce. Add a little salt and pepper, stir through, remove from the heat and set aside.\n2.Mix the dressing ingredients together, check for flavour, adjust if need be and set aside.\n3.Place all the salad ingredients in a bowl except the avocado and the salt and pepper. Prepare the avocado as you are about to serve otherwise it will turn brown. Once it is covered in the lime dressing, this will slow down the oxidization process and it wont go brown so easily.\n4.When you are ready to serve mix  of the avocado through the salad and add the dressing. Toss everything together. Taste to see if you need any salt and pepper. Place your shrimp on top of the salad with the rest of the avocado and sprinkle/pour any residue from the pan over your salad in which you cooked the shrimp. This is great flavour, so you dont want to lose it.",

      "steps": "Fill a 14-16-quart pot with two quarts of water and bring to a boil.\nMeanwhile, peel and devein the shrimp, keeping the heads and hulls. Set the shrimp aside in cold water. In the large \"gumbo pot\" boil heads and hulls for 30 minutes to an hour. This will give you Creole gumbo. Strain shrimp heads and hulls from stock and set aside. Discard heads and hull immediately. Otherwise, the next day your kitchen will smell like Bayou St. John.\nClean the fresh crabs  If the crabs are fresh, you must take time to clean them. Discard the hard back shell and some of the so-called \"dead man,\" or yellow insides. Clean and separate crabs and set aside. (Note: If necessary, you can use meat from king, Dungeness, snow or stone crabs for your gumbo).\nBefore you fire up the stove again, cut up your celery, parsley, peppers, onions and garlic, especially if you're alone and there is no one to help you stir the pots. It takes time peeling the onions and garlic  Put the celery and parsley in a separate container from the other chopped ingredients and refrigerate until needed to keep them fresh.\nPlace the gumbo pot with the shrimp stock on the stove. Add cleaned crabs and bay leaves. Stir slowly. You don't want your shrimp stock messing up the floor. Add celery, parsley, and tomato paste to the gumbo brewing on the stove. Bring to a boil. Turn down heat, cover, and let simmer.\nHere comes the roux -- a thick and flavorful sauce that has become one of the most important staples of Louisiana cuisine. Pour oil or shortening into a separate heavy skillet (please do not use a thin omelet pan) over a medium-low heat. Slowly stir in flour to make the roux. Keep your eyes on the skillet. If the phone rings, let the answering machine pick it up. Cook roux until it has a dark mahogany color. Do not stop stirring until roux appears nutty or grainy. If black specks appear, the roux is burned. Throw it out and start from scratch. A good roux could take 30 to 45 minutes cooking time.\nNow you are ready to add the holy trinity of onions, garlic, and green peppers to the roux mixture. Stir ingredients in slowly because the flour is still sizzling. The moisture will begin to disappear. This is when Jean would add another quart or two of water to the gumbo pot. Add roux to the gumbo pot. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Lower heat and cover. The kitchen should smell good right now. Pour yourself another cold something-or-other. You're halfway there. Come back to look and stir in an hour or so.\nSeason to taste: add salt, pepper, thyme, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce and any Creole seasoning you like. Don't overdo it right now. Let the roux work its magic absorbing all the wonderful ingredients. Gumbo is usually very spicy, but you can keep it mild. Remember, if you have decided to use andouille sausage it is also hot.\nFry sausages and okra with a little bit of the leftover grease. Sprinkle a little leftover flour if the okra is fresh. Add to gumbo pot. Add chopped peeled tomatoes, stirring until well blended. Add more water if necessary. The roux will keep it thick and tasty. Return to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes. Reduce heat and let simmer, uncovered, for 2 1/2 to 3 hours over low heat.\nSkim any excess fat. Add shrimp. Stir in slowly as you increase the heat one last time. It's time to stir in the fil powder. Cook another 20 to 30 minutes until the gumbo is thick. Taste and adjust seasonings one more time. Did I mention the rice? Seafood gumbo is served over Louisiana rice. Of course, you can substitute for your own favorite rice. Just plain old brown or white rice will do. Before serving, taste one more time and adjust seasoning. Turn off heat and remove seafood gumbo from the stove.\nTo cool down the pot before serving, place it in the sink with a few inches of ice-cold water. If needed, add additional salt and Tabasco sauce. If you can see through the gumbo to the bottom of the pot, work on your roux next time.",

Once pulverized add in 1 clove of garlic & continue to grind. Now add in your nuts, lemon juice and a bit of salt & pepper & give it one more grind. At this point abandon the mortal & pestle or the machine & dump the mixture into a bowl.\nAdd a small handful of cheese and while continuously mixing add in the olive oil until you achieve your desired consistency. For crostini I would leave as a paste, for a pasta sauce keep it a bit looser - this is all based on the amount of olive oil you use.\nNow recheck your seasonings - more garlic? A little light on the acid? Add a squeeze of lemon. Is it flat? A pinch of salt will wake it up. Let sit for an hour or so to let the flavors incorporate. Store in the fridge. It will last a few days before the arugula will turn.\nServe tossed over fresh pasta or rubbed over toasty bread with a ribbon of parmesan, a delicious topping for pizza or a beautiful frittata with a dollop of arugula pesto!

      "steps": "<ol><li>Measure flour mix, using a large spoon to scoop flour into the measuring cup, then level it off with the back of a knife. Whisk with the xanthan gum, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk well, breaking up any lumps of cocoa powder. Set aside.</li><li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat shortening and granulated sugar on medium speed, about 2 minutes till fluffy.  Add vanilla extract, applesauce, and egg replacer, and mix till combined, about 30 seconds.</li><li>Add dry ingredients to stand mixer, in two batches, mixing on medium-low speed, until fully combined, scraping down sides of bowl as necessary.</li><li>Using a rubber spatula, transfer cookie dough to a sheet of parchment paper. Mold into a ball. Cut in half, and transfer one half to a second sheet of parchment. Cover both with a top sheet of parchment paper, and use the palm of your hand to press dough down into disks.  Roll out dough to 1/8th-inch thick.  I like to use my trusty rolling pin rings to do this. Transfer rolled out dough to a cutting board, or trays, and chill in fridge at least 2 hours until firm.</li><li>Preheat oven to 325F. Remove one sheet of dough from fridge, and peel off top sheet of parchment. Using a 1 -inch biscuit cutter cut out cookies.  Transfer to parchment lined baking tray, spacing cookies about 1-inch apart. You may want to use a frosting spatula to transfer the cookies. You should be able to fit about 24 cookies per baking tray.</li><li>Bake in center of the oven 10 minutes, till set. Transfer tray to cooling rack, and let cool on tray 5 minutes, before transferring cookies to cooling rack to cool to room temperature.  Repeat with remaining dough, gathering up scraps and re-rolling until youve used it all. I sometimes roll it out and stick it in the freezer for a few minutes to get it to firm up again.</li><li>Once cookies have cooled to room temperature, dump them all into a freezer safe container, and stick them in the freezer, uncovered for about 30 minutes to chill. This will simplify the coating process.</li><li>Combine chocolate chips and shortening in a microwave safe bowl, and melt in microwave, stopping to stir about every 30 seconds, for a total of about 2 minutes.  Do not overcook, as chocolate burns easily. Remove from microwave, and stir till smooth. Add peppermint extract, and mix in well.</li><li>Remove a handful of the chocolate wafers from the freezer.  You will be making these cookies one at a time. Drop one cookie into the melted chocolate mixture. Use a fork to flip it once, so both sides are now coated. Use the fork to lift the cookie out of the chocolate mixture, and run the bottom of the fork along the edge of the bowl, wiping off the extra drips of chocolate. Set coated cookie down on parchment lined baking tray.  Repeat, until youve coated all the cookies.  You can let them set at room temperature, but I speed up the process by sticking them in the fridge for about 30 minutes, till set.  Once the cookies have set, store them in an airtight container, between layers of parchment or wax paper. Keep them in the fridge, or, for longer-term storage, keep them in the freez</li></ol>",

      "steps": "Preheat your oven to 300 degrees.  Place a large heavy bottomed pot on the stove top (like a Le Creuset pot).\nOver medium heat cook 4 strips of Bacon in the large heavy bottomed pot until crisp.  Remove from the heat and allow to drain on paper towels.  Later you will crumble the Bacon into the finished Sauce.  Reserve the Bacon Fat in the pot.\nDry off any moisture on your Beef Short Ribs using paper towel.  The meat will brown better and caramelize instead of steam if it is dry.  This browning will produce a lot of flavor in the finished dish.\nCut the Short Ribs into 3-4 inch sections.  Trim some of the excess outer fat, leaving some for flavor.  Season the Short Ribs with Sea Salt and Black Pepper.\nOver medium high add 3 T of Olive Oil to the Bacon Fat and brown all sides of the Short Ribs until they get a good dark brown sear.  Give the Short Ribs room between each other so they do not steam and brown properly.  You will have to do this in 2 to 3 batches to brown all the Short Ribs well.   You will not be cooking through all the way, just browning at this stage.  The Short Ribs will be raw in the middle.\nPlace the first batch after browning in a bowl to catch any drippings.\nAfter all the Short Ribs are browned well, remove them from the pot and set aside in the large bowl to collect any drippings as they sit.  Next remove the used Bacon Fat and Olive Oil from the pot leaving any of the cooked on bits stuck to the bottom of the pot.  Reduce the heat to medium and add 3 T of fresh Olive Oil and saute the sliced Mushrooms until browned and crisp. 7-10 minutes.\nThen over medium heat add the diced Onions and Carrot and saute until soft, 5-7 minutes.  Add the minced Garlic and cook for 1 minute more.\nDeglaze the pot by adding 2 cups of Cabernet Sauvignon.  As soon as you add the Wine increase the heat to high and stir rapidly, scraping the bottom of the pot releasing the cooked on brown bits stuck to the bottom.  Bring to the boil then add 2 cups of Beef Stock and the Tomato Paste, Beef Base, Thyme, Bay Leaves, Sea Salt and Black Pepper.  Allow to boil, stirring continuously for 3 minutes.\nAdd the Beef Short Ribs and any juices that collected in the bowl to the boiling pot.  Put them in snugly against each other and boil for 2 minutes.\nThen place the lid on the pot and place in the center of the oven and cook for 3 hours at 300 degrees undisturbed.  Don't peek and release the moist heat that will make these Short Ribs fall of the bone.\nAfter 3 hours remove from the oven and take off the lid.  Prepare for a steam facial!  Remove the Cooked Beef Short Ribs to a large bowl.  Be gentle, it will be falling off the bone.  Allow the Sauce to sit for 3 minutes so the fat rises to the top.  Skim off the fat using a large spoon and discard it.  Remove as much as you can.  Remove the Bay Leaves and stems from the Thyme if you used fresh Thyme.\nRemember, the pot is HOT, it just came from the oven!!!  Use pot holders and place the pot of defatted Sauce over medium high heat and bring to a boil, stirring frequently, and reduce by a third.  This will concentrate the Sauce into a rich incredible Sauce. Taste the Sauce and add Sea Salt and or Black Pepper is needed at this point.  Crumble the Bacon and add to the Sauce stirring in well.\nAdd the Beef Short Ribs back to the pot of reduced Sauce and remove from the heat.  Coat the Short Ribs in the Sauce well.  Serve Immediately over Yukon Gold Mashed Potatoes or Polenta.",

Watch carefully!  (If you miss this point, the sugar will quickly turn too dark and you will have to start all over again).  Immediately pour liquid caramel into 6 3-1/2 inch ramekins and swirl to cover bottom evenly. The caramel hardens rapidly, so work quickly.

In the meantime, heat milk and sugar in a saucepan until just warmed and sugar has dissolved.  Whisk eggs and vanilla in a large bowl until blended.

Tear open and pull out the seed pod and stem.\nSauce\nIn a blender combine the peppers, flour, and half of the suero or buttermilk and blend until creamy. Pour mixture into medium skillet and set over medium-low heat to warm. Add additional suero or buttermilk and stir. Taste and season with salt, usually about 2 teaspoons. If the sauce is too spicy, add  cup of crema or sour cream and stir. If the sauce is too thick, add water until desired consistency is reached.\nChicken (Optional)\nIn a pot with enough water to cover, boil chicken breasts 25 minutes or until juices run clear. Drain, cool, and shred. Optional time-saver: shred a store bought rotisserie chicken.\nStacked Style\nFry tortillas in hot oil until softened. Drain on paper towels. Soften tortillas by soaking in sauce one at a time. Place softened tortillas on individual serving plates. Layer with cooked chicken, cheese, and onion.

You should roll half of pastry for the bottom side of cakes and half of pastry for upper side off the cakes. The size should be just a little bigger than the size of your baking dish.\nBake the pastry for about 10-15 minutes until golden brown. Cool the upper layer completely. Leave the second one (bottom layer) in the baking dish.\nDivide egg yolks from egg whites, putting egg whites in to the larger bowl.\nFor the egg yolk mixture, add sugar, vanilla and rum to the egg yolks into a smaller bowl. Mix them together for a minute or two. Add flour and 1/4 off milk and mix together to get a smooth mixture.\nMix egg whites in the large bowl until firm consistency. Then add sugar and mix again. The consistency after adding the sugar should be very firm.\nPut the rest of the milk in to a large cooking pot and bring it to boiling point. Take a whisk and slowly pour the egg yolk mixture in to boiling milk, whisking the whole time. Cook it for 5 minutes, whisking the whole time. After 5 minutes the consistency should be thick and very hard for you to whisk.\nNOW THE CRUCIAL AN THE HARDEST PART  IT IS BETTER THAT TWO PERSONS DO THIS\nTake the boiling mixture of the stove.

When mixed, immediately pour the mixture in to the baking dish in which you have the bottom layer of baked pastry.\nShake the baking dish slightly so that every corner of pastry gets field, and leave it to cool (best is over night in the refrigerator).\nMix sugar and whipping cream in a bowl. Put whipped cream on the top off the cooled mixture.\nTake the other baked pastry and cut it in to 15 same sized squares. Put the squares on to the whipped cream.\nJust before serving cut the cakes in to squares and sprinkle powdered sugar on top.",

Pour the brine into a deep set large bowl and cool it down with your ice water.  Set aside.</li><li>Clean the chicken by rinsing out the cavity and outer skin and place on a clean surface.  Be sure not to contaminate any vegetables or other ingredients, because no one is a fan of salmonella!  Place the chicken in the brine,  make sure it is completely immersed in the brine.  Cover and allow to marinate for at least an hour and up to 6 hours.</li><li>Preheat the oven to 375F.</li><li>Remove the chicken from the brine and place on a clean surface.  Pat the chicken dry with a paper towel as shown.  Separate the skin from the flesh, you can do this by carefully inserting your fingers underneath the skin and gently pull up to create a space or pocket.  Take the butter and rub it underneath the skin and flesh  this will make your chicken moist and tender while accentuating the flavor of the herbs in the meat.  Coat the skin with te remaining herbs and place in a roasting pan, if more herbs are needed just add more.</li><li>Bake the chicken for about 1 hour and 10 minutes, basting the chicken half way through and again during the last 10 minutes.  To test the doneness of your chicken, insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the breast, it should read 165F.  If you do not own a thermometer, cut into the chicken and if it releases pink juices it is undercooked.  Your chicken is done when the juices are a clear yellow.</li><li>Transfer the chicken to a carving board and allow it to rest for 10-20 minutes.  This allows the juices to settle into the meat so it does not end up running out all over the board.  To serve, begin carving the legs it is easiest to cut at the joints.  Remove the wings and then the legs and thighs the same way.  To carve each breast, start at the breabone and cut downward and parallel to the rib cage.  Then make a deep horizontal cut right above the thigh and wing joints.  You can choose to serve the breasts whole or cut them into thin slices.</li></ol>",

      "steps": "To prepare the skewers:\nSoak 8 bamboo skewers in water for at least 30 minutes. Set aside.\nTo make the sauce:\nCut the top of the dried chili and shake out the seeds. Transfer them into a saucepan along with the prunes, broth, tomatoes, tomato paste, onion, molasses, garlic, pumpkin seeds, cumin, and oregano. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat and cook for 2 minutes; then lower the heat to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes more.\nUsing an immersion blender, puree the mixture until completely smooth. Return to the heat and simmer, uncovered, for another 15 to 20 minutes. (If you dont have an immersion blender, carefully ladle the sauce into a food processor, and process until smooth, working in batches; then return to the pot.) Set the sauce aside until ready to serve with the corndogs, or if you are making this ahead of time, once the sauce has cooled, transfer it to a container and refrigerate.\nTo prepare the corn dogs:\nIn a mixing bowl, combine the masa harina, cornmeal,  cup of the rice flour, baking powder, brown sugar, and salt and mix to combine. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well to combine. Add the rice milk and lime juice and mix to combine. The mixture should resemble a thick pancake batter; if more milk is needed, add by the tablespoonful. Cover and refrigerate the mixture if you are not going to be frying right away.\nWhen you are ready to cook, heat the oil in a saucepan until it registers 350F on a deep-frying thermometer. While the oil is heating, place the remaining rice flour on a paper plate and set aside. Cut each chicken sausage in half crosswise, to make eight pieces.\nRoll each piece of sausage in the rice flour to lightly coat. Thread the moistened bamboo skewers through the sausage pieces, so that the tips of the skewers are not quite poking out the top. Holding it by its skewer, dip a floured sausage piece into the batter, until it is completely coated. Carefully lift the stick and hold it over the bowl for a few seconds, allowing any excess batter to drip off. Repeat with another skewer. Carefully place two corn dogs into the hot oil and cook until they are crusty on the outside, and dark golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels and keep warm. Repeat with each skewered sausage, allowing the oil to return to 350F in between. Serve immediately with the chili.",

      "steps": "Make the pastry: Place the cut up butter pieces in the freezer for 15 minutes to chill. Meanwhile, in the work bowl of a food processor combine flour, sugar, dry mustard, salt and cayenne pepper. Pulse to combine. After the butter has chilled, scatter the pieces over the flour mixture (still in the food processor), along with the cheddar. Pulse about 10 times. Sprinkle half the ice water over the dough, pulse about 3 times, repeat with remaining water, pulsing 3 more times. Pinch the dough to check if it sticks together, if not add a tablespoon or two more ice water, until it comes together. Dump the mix in a large bowl and press it together to form the dough. Divide dough in half, shaping each into a 4-inch disk. Wrap each piece in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least an hour.\nBegin the filling: Pat the meat dry with paper towels and season with salt & pepper. Heat 2 t. oil in a large skillet over medium high heat until just smoking. Add the meat in a single layer and cook, without stirring, until the meat browns well on the underside, anywhere between 5-10 minutes (the meat will give off liquid, just let it evaporate - leave it alone!) Stir the meat and cook another couple minutes, until it looses the raw color. Remove to a plate and set aside.\nReduce heat to medium, add the remaining 2 t. oil and the onions and carrots. Saute until softened and starting to brown, stirring occasionally, around 5 minutes. Add the garlic, thyme and marjoram, cook until very fragrant, about a minute. Stir in flour, cook and stir about a minute. Slowly add in the beef broth and water, then the meat, along with any juices left on the plate. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low, to med-low. Cover and cook, (adjusting the heat as necessary to maintain a simmer) stirring occasionally until the meat is just becoming tender, around 45 minutes. Remove from heat, add in the Dijon and parsley. Adjust seasoning with salt & pepper. Set aside to cool.\nRolling out the crust, filling & baking the pot pies: Remove the dough from the refrigerator 10 minutes before rolling it out. Roll the dough out on a well-floured surface, large enough to cut out 3, 7-inch circles out of each half (save the scraps). Line each cup of a large-sized muffin tin with the dough. (It won't look very pretty, you just kind of have your way with it to get it pressed in there.) Refrigerate the filled tins as well as the dough scraps 15 minutes to firm back up.\nMeanwhile, preheat oven to 400 degrees. After 15 minutes and the filling has cooled down quite a bit. Divide the mixture evenly between crusts. Divide the remaining dough into 6 balls. Roll out each piece wide enough to cover the pot pies. Pinch the top and bottom crust edges together to seal, and finish the edges in whatever decorative way you like. Brush the tops with the beaten egg. Bake 35-40 minutes, rotating the pan after 20 minutes. Remove from oven & let sit 5 minutes before (carefully) removing the pot pies from the tin.",

Now you are ready to assemble.</li><li>Heat up your olive oil in a small frying pan. Add your corn tortilla for about 20 seconds, flipping if the oil doesn't reach the top side.

Fill the remaining tortillas in the same way and line them up next to each other on your cookie sheet, so they are very close to each other, but not touching. This should make two rows on each of your cookie sheets.</li><li>If two pans are too much for your family, then at this point, take one pan and put it in your freezer. Once the enchiladas are frozen, remove them from the pan and stack them in a double lined ziploc freezer bag.

In a heavy-bottomed pot (I love my Le Creuset), add sugar, water and corn syrup over medium-high heat. Let mixture bubble and stir occasionally, to evaporate water. Sugar will begin to caramelize and turn a lovely shade of amber.\nUse a thermometer to monitor caramel. When it reaches 320 degrees and is golden brown in color, slowly whisk in cream, butter and vanilla, until completely combined. When caramel reaches 243 degrees, remove from heat and pour into lined baking sheet. Cool for 15 minutes, and add bacon strips. Cool further, until caramel is pliable and easier to handle.\nRoll caramel and bacon strips jelly-roll style once, and trim off excess. Continue to roll and trim until youve finished off the pan. Cut the bacon caramel logs into bite-sized pieces. Top with reserved bacon bits.\nServe on a platter, or roll in wax paper. Keep refrigerated, but let come to room temperature before eating.http://www.fureyandthefeast.com/2009/09/bacon-caramels/",
